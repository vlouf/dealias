# UNRAVEL

**UNfold RAdar VELocity (UNRAVEL)** is an open-source modular Doppler velocity dealiasing algorithm for weather radars. Designed for flexibility, UNRAVEL does not require external reference velocity data, making it highly adaptable across various contexts.

## Features
- **Modular Design:** Consists of **eleven core modules** and **two dealiasing strategies** for iterative processing.
- **Adaptive Dealiasing:** Starts with strict continuity tests in azimuth and range, then progressively relaxes parameters to include more reference points.
- **3D Continuity Checks:** Modules for multi-dimensional dealiasing enhance accuracy.
- **Expandable Framework:** Allows for additional strategies to optimize results further.

## Requirements
To use UNRAVEL, install the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install h5py numba numpy xarray pyodim dask pyart
```

## Installation

UNRAVEL is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/unravel/). The easiest method for installing UNRAVEL is to use pip:

```pip install unravel```
